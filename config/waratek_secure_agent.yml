# Service configuration
# Currently, this framework requires this setting in addition to the application
# setting an env variable in its manifest, "waratek_required: true"
# Currently not properly used - in place to keep the detect phase happy and
# will be used when we've created a version-indexed list of releases for products
# Repo root not used as we have to set one up as per the contract
# A URI will be used and specified by the application in its manifest to access a specific release
# in zip format which unpacks its contents in its current directory - see docs
